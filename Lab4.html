            Show the recipe for grilled cheese sandwiches with bacon and tomato. The ingredients should be displayed as an unordered list, with no bullets. Meat ingredients should have a light red background color, vegetables should have a light green background, and dairy products should have a light yellow. The title should be in a sans serif font of your choice, and the instructions should have a heading "Instructions" and the font for the instructions should be italic. All this can be done in CSS.

              Place 4 strips of bacon into a large skillet. Cook over medium heat until browned. Drain excess fat/grease from the skillet and pat bacon with a paper towel to absorb excess fat/grease. Spread 1 tbsp butter in the skillet and 1 tbsp butter onto one side of each of the 4 slices of bread. Place the 4 slices onto the skillet butter-side down. On two of the slices of bread, add 1 slice of cheese, 2 slices of tomato, 2 slices of bacon, then 1 more slice of cheese. Use a spatula to flip the empty slices of bread onto the top of the two slices with toppings (with the butter-side up on the top slice). Fry over medium heat until the bottom slice of bread is golden-brown, then flip the entire sandwich over until both sides are golden-brown. Enjoy!
