          Fork lab 2 Repl.it to copy for lab 3. Add a lab3.html page to the project. Add a Lab 3 hyperlink to the index page and all other pages. Add semantic tags to each page in your site. Use at least &lt;header&gt; &lt;nav&gt; &lt;main&gt; and &lt;footer&gt;. Recall that those don't change the look of the resulting page, they only divide your page into logical chunks. ioT devices could now understand your page layout. Add an images folder to your site. Drag & Drop a header banner or logo image to this folder. Careful with copyright infringement! Please use resources from the Creative Commons or something you create yourself. You can also add your image from lab 1. Add this logo to all pages. Use the existing style sheet / CSS file: add a style for the body tag. Add a font color and a background color (there is a trick, watch the video). Also go out to w3Schools CSS page to get inspired. Run your pages to see the result.
